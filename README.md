CNN to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures of pets

The model was trained on a dataset of 4000 images each of cats and dogs and tested on 1000 images each of cats and dogs. The CNN model was found to have an accuracy of 82 % on the test set.

The model can also be used to recognize and predict any two classes of data. Simply add the images to a dataset folder in the same directory as the model and provide its link in the rnn.py file.
